This project involves developing an application for a Health Club that assists employees in calculating membership fees for customers. The program offers a user-friendly interface where employees can select membership types, membership lengths, and additional club options like Yoga, Karate, or a personal trainer. The program calculates and displays both the monthly fee and the total cost for the entire membership duration based on the chosen options. The membership fee per month varies for different categories: Standard Adult, Child (age 12 and under), Student, and Senior Citizen. Additionally, there are extra costs for add-on options. To meet the project's requirements, the program must employ functions for calculations, implement input validation, use meaningful names for code and controls, and ensure proper formatting of outputs as currency values. This application simplifies the process of calculating membership fees and helps streamline customer transactions at the Health Club.
